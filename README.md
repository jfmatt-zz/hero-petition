hero-petition
=============

An effort to transcode the petitions to repeal Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance.

Background: [Mystery Campaign Publishes Names, Addresses Of Opponents Of LGBT-Discrimination Ban](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/mystery-campaign-publishes-names-addresses-of-opponents-of-l)

Thanks to the HERO Petition campaign, we have all the signatures of everyone who signed the 'No Unequal Rights' anti-LGBT petition. 


There are a couple goals:

- 1) To validate that these signatures are legit and represent people who actually signed
- 2) To transcode the handwritten signature list to a computer processable format that could be use for further research



## Structure

The folder `petition-csv` contains a CSV for every petition page. They are organized by page and box. So, A-1.csv contains the signatures for box A, page 1. 

## How to Help

Unfortunately, github won't allow the pdfs to stay in the repo (they're too big), so you'll have to download the pdfs if you'd like to help. Simply choose a page from a box (A-G) that have not been transcoded and get to it!. You'll notice the base CSV template already has the field headers you'll need to fill in for every signature row. 

### Steps

* Fork this repo
* Choose a box and a page to do. There will be between 1 and 15 rows to transcode.
* If you want to be sure no one else is working on it, place your github handle in the README.md located in each BOX. Put the page and rows you intend on committing. Submit a pull request of that readme.
* Download that box's pdf (links below), find that page, modify the csv with your favorite spreadsheet editor. Make every attempt to fill in every row.
* Once done, submit a pull request and I'll merge your changes in, mark your changes are completed in the appropriate README.md and send you my thanks.
