hero-petition
=============

An effort to transcode the petitions to repeal Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance.

Background: [Story](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/mystery-campaign-publishes-names-addresses-of-opponents-of-l)

Thanks to the HERO Petition campaign, we have all the signatures of everyone who signed the 'No Unequal Rights' anti-LGBT petition. 


There are a couple goals:

1) To validate that these signatures are legit and represent people who actually signed
2) To transcode the handwritten signature list to a computer processable format that could be use for further research



## Structure

The folder `petition-csv` contains a CSV for every petition page. They are organized by page and box. So, A-1.csv contains the signatures for box A, page 1. 

## How to Help

Unfortunately, github won't allow the pdfs to stay in the repo (they're too big), so you'll have to download the pdfs if you'd like to help. Simply choose a page from a box (A-G) that have not been transcoded and get to it!. You'll notice the base CSV template already has the field headers you'll need to fill in for every signature row. I hope to soon publish a TODO list of sorts, letting people know what has or has not been touched.
